## Problem

GameCo intends to develop new games to remain competitive in the market. They seek market, competitor, and sales insights to make the best use of their resources.

## Objective

To perform a descriptive analysis of a video game data set to assist GameCo in predicting how their new games will perform in the market.


## Key Insights

### How have sales figures varied between geographic regions over time?

I created this line graph using an Excel pivot table to analyze whether sales growth varied across different geographic regions over time.

- The data indicates a significant shift in sales trends both chronologically and across various geographical locations.
- Although North American sales were the highest, there has been a gradual decline in sales for all regions since 2008.
  

### Which publishers are expected to be the main competitors in the market?

Through the analysis of an Excel pivot table, I found that Electronic Arts dominated the market in terms of global sales from 2011 to 2016.

### Are certain types of games more popular than others?

The pie chart was created using worldwide sales data to illustrate the globally preferred gaming genre and to highlight the sales of all genres in each region.

- The leading gaming genres are Action and Shooter.

## Recommendations

- Allocating additional resources to Action and Shooter Genres is advisable.
- The Action genre enjoys widespread popularity in all markets except Japan, where it ranks second.
- Prioritizing investments in the stable EU and Japanese markets could be a less risky strategy.
- Caution is advised due to the ongoing decline in the North American market.
- Monitoring the performance of Electronic Arts is crucial, as they currently lead the market.
